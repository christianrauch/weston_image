 * clients assess the reliability of the feedback and the visual
 * quality with respect to possible tearing and timings. The
 * flags are:
 *
 * VSYNC:
 * The presentation was synchronized to the "vertical retrace" by
 * the display hardware such that tearing does not happen.
 * Relying on user space scheduling is not acceptable for this
 * flag. If presentation is done by a copy to the active
 * frontbuffer, then it must guarantee that tearing cannot
 * happen.
 *
 * HW_CLOCK:
 * The display hardware provided measurements that the hardware
 * driver converted into a presentation timestamp. Sampling a
 * clock in user space is not acceptable for this flag.
 *
 * HW_COMPLETION:
 * The display hardware signalled that it started using the new
 * image content. The opposite of this is e.g. a timer being used
 * to guess when the display hardware has switched to the new
 * image content.
 *
 * ZERO_COPY:
 * The presentation of this update was done zero-copy. This means
 * the buffer from the client was given to display hardware as
 * is, without copying it. Compositing with OpenGL counts as
 * copying, even if textured directly from the client buffer.
 * Possible zero-copy cases include direct scanout of a
 * fullscreen surface and a surface on a hardware overlay.
